Leetcode 684. Redundant Connection

Description:
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, 
with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, 
and was not an edge that already existed. 
The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] 
indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. 
If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
