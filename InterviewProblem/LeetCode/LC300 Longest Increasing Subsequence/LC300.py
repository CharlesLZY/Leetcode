Leetcode 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Description:
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some 
or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

### DP Solution
### TC: O(n^2) and SC: O(n)
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
        DP_table = [1]*len(nums) ### DP[i] epresents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at i
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    DP_table[i] = max(DP_table[i], DP_table[j]+1) ### DP[i] = max(DP[j]) + 1 where 0 <= j < i and nums[i] > nums[j]
        return max(DP_table)


### Stack Solution 
### TC: O(n^2) and SC: O(n) (TC can be optimized to O(nlogn))
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
        stack = [nums[0]] ### store the longest increasing subsequence with smallest numbers

        The length remains correct because the length only changes when a new element is larger than any element in the stack. 
        In that case, the element is appended to the subsequence instead of replacing an existing element. 
        And the largest element in the stack will also be updated by new elements.

        for num in nums[1:]:

                If we temporarily can not extend longest subsquence, we can update the former subsquence.
                The former subsquence can be substituted by smaller number.
                If we can update stack[-1], then the current longest subsquence will be easier to extend.
